### 2019 Team

Hello! We're a team of developers and designers who flew in from around the world to work on the WorldWideWeb rebuild project from February 10 to February 16, 2019. That photo above is a shot of us standing just outside the basement server room for all data gathering, processing, and backup for experiments at CERN.

### This site

This site is a static site, compiled using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) hosted by CERN. 

The design is inspired by the pallet and simplicity of the original NeXT OS. We mainly use standard system sans-serif fonts (San Francisco on Macos, for example). Our font stack is: `BlinkMacSystemFont, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;`

But for our main header, we employ a special, retro-designed edition of Helvetica, as pulled from screenshots of the NeXT box.
