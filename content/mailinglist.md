### www-talk, the World Wide Web Mailing list

On the 28th October 1991. Tim Berners-Lee started the [World Wide Web mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1991SepOct/0001.html), which has in one form or another run ever since, though it's rarely posted to today.  

It documents many of the innovations of the Web in the last 28 years, 





Some notable, or interesting conversations over the years include


* A conversation from 1991 which [prefigured the HTML5 document outline algorithm](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1991SepOct/0003.html) many years in advance 
* The first consideration of [what a programming language for the browser might look like](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1992MayJun/0006.html). 
* Early discussions on what [forms and tables in the browser might look like](http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q2/0015.html). Forms are not much more advanced in many ways today than in the initial suggestion. 
* Netscape founder [Marc Andreesen proposed the IMG tag](http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0182.html), for embedding images into HTML document, something [Tim Berners-Lee wasn't particularly supportive of](http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0186.html) in the format proposed.
