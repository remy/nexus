Hickson, then at Opera Software, proposed that ""the W3C develop declarative extension to HTML and CSS and imperative extensions to DOM, to address medium level Web Application requirements, as opposed to sophisticated, fully-fledged OS-level APIs"". This was rejected by 14 votes to 8.
The report for this workshop concludes: ""At present, W3C does not intend to put any resources into the third straw-poll topic: extensions to HTML and CSS for Web Applications, other than technologies being developed under the charter of current W3C Working Groups"".
As a response to this perceived ""[lack of] direction with XHTML, lack of interest in HTML and apparent disregard for the needs of real-world authors"", the <a href=""http://wiki.whatwg.org/"">WHATWG</a> was formed, from which came what is now termed HTML5.",,,,,,milestones
