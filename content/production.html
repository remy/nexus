	<h3>Digital Archeology</h3>

	<p>We arrived at CERN and spent the first day figuring out the task at hand: How do we pull apart the old WorldWideWeb browser to best emulate it in a contemporary browser?</p>

	<p>Thankfully, we had an old NeXT box (almost but not quite the very one on which Tim Berners-Lee developed the WorldWideWeb application). </p>

	<h3>Oral Histories</h3>

	<p>We had a lovely lunch with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau">Robert Cailliau</a>, designer of the WWW logo (which we're using as our favicon!), and collaborator with Tim Berners-Lee on developing the World Wide Web.</p>

	<h3>Past Developers</h3>
	<p>Jean-Francois Groff hung out with us for a few days to help elucidate some of the design details of the WorldWideWeb browser, and to help us get some of the history straight. He wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libwww">wwwlib</a> with Tim Berners-Lee which became the core library for most modern web browsers.</p>
