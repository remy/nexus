We had a lovely lunch with [Robert Cailliau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau), designer of the WWW logo, and collaborator with Tim Berners-Lee on developing the world wide web.

Jean-Francois Groff hung out with us for a few days to help elucidate some of the design details of the WorldWideWeb browser, and to help us get some of the history straight. He wrote [wwwlib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libwww) with Tim Berners-Lee which became the core library for most modern web browsers.
